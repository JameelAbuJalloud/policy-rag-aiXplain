## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

Policy RAG follows a modern full-stack architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### Backend Components

The backend is built with Flask and provides a RESTful API for document processing and question answering. Key components include:

**Main Application (`main.py`)**: The Flask application server that handles HTTP requests, manages CORS, and coordinates between different services. It provides endpoints for document upload, question processing, and system health checks.

**Document Indexing Service (`indexing_service.py`)**: Responsible for processing uploaded documents, extracting text content, creating embeddings using AiXplain's models, and storing them in ChromaDB for efficient retrieval. Supports multiple file formats including PDF, CSV, TXT, and JSON.

**Answer Generation (`aixplain_processor.py`)**: Handles the core AI functionality by interfacing with AiXplain's language models. It performs semantic search across the document collection and generates contextual responses with proper source attribution.

**Federal Register Integration (`tools/federal_register_tool.py`)**: Provides real-time access to executive order information through the Federal Register API, enabling users to get current status updates on government policies.

### Frontend Components

The frontend is a React application that provides an intuitive interface for document management and AI-powered conversations:

**Main Application (`App.js`)**: The primary React component that manages the user interface, handles file uploads, displays chat conversations, and provides document management capabilities.

**Styling**: Uses Tailwind CSS for modern, responsive design with dark/light mode support.

### Data Storage

**ChromaDB Vector Store**: Persistent vector database that stores document embeddings for efficient semantic search. Configured with cosine similarity for optimal retrieval performance.

**File Storage**: Local file system storage for uploaded documents with organized directory structure:
- `initial_files/`: Pre-loaded policy documents
- `uploaded_files/`: User-uploaded documents
- `chromadb_data/`: Vector database storage

### AI Integration

**AiXplain Platform**: Integration with AiXplain's advanced language models for both text embedding generation and response generation. The system uses separate models optimized for each task to ensure high-quality results.

   # Edit .env with your API keys (see Configuration section)
   ```

6. **Initialize Data Directories** (if they don't exist)
   ```bash
   mkdir -p initial_files uploaded_files chromadb_data
   ```

7. **Start the Application**
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1: Start backend
   python main.py
   
   # Terminal 2: Start frontend (in a new terminal)
   npm start
   ```

   The application will be available at:
   - Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
   - Backend API: `http://localhost:5001`

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Policy RAG uses environment variables for configuration. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following settings:

### Required Configuration

```env
# AiXplain API Configuration
AIXPLAIN_API_KEY=your_aixplain_api_key_here
AIXPLAIN_EMBEDDING_MODEL_ID=your_embedding_model_id
AIXPLAIN_TEXT_GEN_MODEL_ID=your_text_generation_model_id

# Flask Application Settings
FLASK_APP=main.py
FLASK_ENV=development
```

### Configuration Details

**AIXPLAIN_API_KEY**: Your personal API key from AiXplain. This is required for all AI functionality including document embedding and response generation. Obtain this from your AiXplain dashboard under API Keys section.

**AIXPLAIN_EMBEDDING_MODEL_ID**: The model ID for text embedding generation. This model converts your documents into vector representations for semantic search.

**AIXPLAIN_TEXT_GEN_MODEL_ID**: The model ID for text generation. This model generates responses to user questions based on the retrieved document context.

**FLASK_ENV**: Set to `development` for local development with debug mode enabled, or `production` for deployment environments.

**CHROMA_DB_PATH**: Directory path where ChromaDB will store the vector database files. This should be a persistent location to maintain your document index between application restarts.

### Security Considerations

- Never commit your `.env` file to version control
- Use strong, unique API keys
- Regularly rotate your API keys
- Consider using environment-specific key management systems in production
- Implement rate limiting for production deployments
